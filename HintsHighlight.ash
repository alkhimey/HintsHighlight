 *
 * @section DESCRIPTION 
 *
 * This module adds a hinting system to your game. Hints are circles or rectangles
 * which highlight hotspots in the game. Players which are stuck and wish to skip the
 * "pixel hunting" stage of a game, can press a button to display an overlay layer with
 * all clickable hotspots highlighted by a shape.
 * 
 * The most basic way to integrate this module into you game is to add the script files.
 * 
 * The default implementation displays the layer as long as the "H" key is help down. 
 * 
 * The user of this module can also provide it's own implementation of when and how to
 * activate the layer with the hints. This is configurable through the USE_CUSTOM_HANDLING
 * parameter. After setting USE_CUSTOM_HANDLING to true, the user must call CalculateHintsForRoom
 * and DisplayHints/HideHints on it's own.
 *
 * Additionally, DisableHints/EnableHints to control when it is applicable to show the layer. 
 * For example, upon entering the menu, a user can call DisableHints and upon returning to 
 * the game, EnableHints can be called.
 *
 * Please see the asc file for more configuration options.
